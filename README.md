# **Acinetobacter Genomic Analysis Workflow**

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks documenting the complete bioinformatics workflow used for genomic analysis of Acinetobacter spp. isolates. The pipeline covers genome assembly processing, quality assessment, species identification, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) gene detection, plasmid and mobile genetic element analysis, and population genomics.

The notebooks are designed to:

- Provide a reproducible and modular analysis framework

- Serve as an execution record for each analytical step

- Facilitate transparency and reuse of the workflow in similar bacterial genomics studies

Each notebook focuses on a specific stage of the analysis and can be run independently or as part of the full workflow.
